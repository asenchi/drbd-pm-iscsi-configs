POD1 BLADE16 - CentOS

SAN notes:
* SAN1 bonded eth{0,1} on external network, eth{2,3} bonded crossover
* SAN2 eth0 on external network, eth{2,3} bonded crossover
* SAN2 will not have a bonded external interface due to limitations in chassis switch ports
* drbd listens and manages over crossovers. SAN1 will be primary.
* Need to figure out node names in drbd configuration. Mostly a testing issue.

BLADE notes:
* Virtuozzo install
* iscsi initiator install
* Run super duper tests on the disks
*
